Materials for the Chassis:
Cardboard and Fiberglass
This chassis was created in layers (3 layers glued together with glue, 2 of cardboard and one of fiberglass) so that it can achieve a more
resistant surface, where the fiberglass is located in the center to better support the weight and provide rigidity, and the cardboard on both
the top and bottom to cushion any impact that may occur.

Materials for the Steering System:
Acrylic, Height Sticks and two alternator bearings.
Acrylic was used as the main material because it is easy to handle, lightweight, and sufficiently resistant for its function. On the other hand,
the height sticks were the simplest material that helped with the steering movement.
