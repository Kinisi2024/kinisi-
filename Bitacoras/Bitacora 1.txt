   A week ago, as a team, we began meeting to discuss our project, during which our colleague Carmelo came up with a possible name and suggested
    the Greek word "kinisi," meaning movement.

We presented and discussed a paper sketch of the steering model, and it was proposed to create a cardboard model to assess all factors that
could enhance or impact our project. Upon review, we concluded that we would explore the possibility of using gears to convert circular motion
into linear motion. We also researched the most feasible placement for each component in the car to enhance its speed and functionality.
