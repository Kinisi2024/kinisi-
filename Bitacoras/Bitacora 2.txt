After discussing the steering system sketch, today we began creating a prototype of its operation using acrylic and tall toothpicks.
Additionally, we fabricated the car chassis from acrylic. We compiled a list of necessary components and placed an order for the following items:

- Color sensor: to determine parking location and avoid obstacles.
- Gear motor with wheel: for vehicle traction.
- Servo motor: for steering control.
- Ultrasonic sensor: to detect obstacles.
- Arduino UNO: for programming the car.
- Motor shield: to connect the motors.
- Battery.
