A gear motor, due to its inherent ability to reduce rotational speed while simultaneously increasing torque, was deemed the optimal choice for
precisely controlling the speed and force required by Kinisi's [autonomous vehicle] system.

Torque:
Kinisi's autonomous vehicle utilizes two high-torque gear motors for robust locomotion. Each motor boasts the following performance
characteristics:

Operating Voltage: 3V - 12V (recommended 6V - 9V)

Current Draw:

* No Load: 100 mA
* Full Load: 200 mA

Maximum Torque: 1 kg/cm

Speed (Under Load):

* 3V: 90 RPM
* 6V: 190 RPM
* 9V: 230 RPM

Gearbox: 1:48 plastic gear ratio

Currently, the motors are operating at their maximum recommended voltage of 9V, achieving a top speed of 230 RPM. 

Important Note: It's critical to remember that Kinisi's drive system utilizes two motors coupled through a shared axle. This effectively doubles
the overall torque output, enhancing the vehicle's ability to traverse varied terrain and manage heavier payloads.

Impact on Kinisi's Performance:

The combination of high torque and controlled speed offered by these gear motors directly contributes to Kinisi's remarkable performance as an
autonomous vehicle:

* Strong Tractive Force: The high torque allows Kinisi to tackle inclines, uneven surfaces, and obstacles with ease.
* Precise Control: The gear motor's ability to precisely control speed and force enables smooth and responsive navigation, even in tight spaces.
* Energy Efficiency: Operating at the recommended voltage ensures optimal power utilization, maximizing runtime and minimizing energy consumption.

This detailed analysis highlights the key role of the gear motors in Kinisi's robust and efficient operation, showcasing the intelligent design
that drives this autonomous vehicle.
