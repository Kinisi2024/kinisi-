TCS3200 Color Sensor Implementation for Kinisi:
The TCS3200 color sensor, equipped with a combination of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodiodes, enables the autonomous vehicle to
perceive color and execute corresponding navigation commands. This implementation utilizes the sensor's color detection capabilities to direct
the vehicle's path based on specific color stimuli. 

The autonomous system is programmed to respond to the following color inputs:

* Green: Upon detecting green,Kinisi executes a left turn maneuver.
* Red: Detection of red triggers a right turn maneuver. 
* Magenta: When magenta is identified, Kinisi performs a parallel parking maneuver.

This color-based navigation scheme is implemented within the Arduino code, forming the core logic for the vehicle's autonomous decision-making
process. The sensor's data is continuously processed, and the resulting color information is interpreted to trigger the appropriate maneuvers.
This integration of the TCS3200 color sensor enhances the Kinisiâ€™s capabilities, enabling it to navigate its environment based on visual cues.
