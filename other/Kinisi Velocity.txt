   Our vehicle utilizes a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) range of 160 to 190 for speed control. This range was determined through experimentation, 
as the Arduino platform supports a PWM resolution of 0 to 255, which effectively controls the pulse width and hence, the power delivered to the
motor. Employing these values within this specific range has proven to be highly effective in achieving optimal performance and control of
Kinisi across multiple testing rounds.
