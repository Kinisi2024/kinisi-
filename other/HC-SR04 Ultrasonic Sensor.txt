Our autonomous vehicle incorporates an array of three HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors. These sensors provide highly accurate distance measurements
through pulse-based echolocation, serving as the cornerstone of the vehicle's obstacle avoidance and navigation system.

This sensor array plays a crucial role in enabling the vehicle to:

* Obstacle Avoidance: By continuously scanning the surrounding environment, the sensors detect obstacles within the vehicle's path. This data is
processed within the Arduino code to activate appropriate avoidance maneuvers, preventing collisions with walls and other obstacles on the track.
* Strategic Navigation: The sensor readings are also used to guide the vehicle's decision-making process for navigating specific turns and
intersections. The distances to walls and track boundaries are analyzed, facilitating intelligent decisions regarding the direction of turns.

This integration of a multi-sensor system, coupled with the robust processing capabilities of the Arduino platform, empowers the vehicle with
the ability to navigate its environment autonomously while ensuring safe and efficient movement.
