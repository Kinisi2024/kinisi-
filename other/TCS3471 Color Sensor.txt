Kinisi's Color-Sensing Navigation: TCS3471 RGB Sensor Integration

Kinisi, our autonomous vehicle, is poised for a significant upgrade with the implementation of the TCS3471 RGB color sensor. This sensor empowers Kinisi with advanced navigational capabilities, allowing it to respond intelligently to color cues in its environment. 

How the TCS3471 Works:

The TCS3471 is a highly sensitive color sensor capable of detecting and measuring red, green, and blue (RGB) light intensities. This data, along with clear ambient light readings, provides a detailed color profile for Kinisi's perception of its surroundings.

Integrating the Sensor with Arduino and ESP:

The TCS3471 seamlessly integrates with Arduino and ESP32 microcontrollers via the I2C protocol. This enables us to read the color sensor data using a simple library and write code to interpret it for Kinisi's navigation.

Kinisi's Color-Coded Navigation:

With the TCS3471 in place, Kinisi's navigation takes on a new dimension:

• Green: Turn Left: When the sensor detects a dominant green color, Kinisi will execute a left turn, navigating around an obstacle or following a pre-defined route. 
• Red: Turn Right: Similarly, a red color detection triggers a right turn, guiding Kinisi away from potential hazards or following a specific path.
• Magenta: Parallel Parking: A magenta color signal, likely placed on the ground or a nearby object, instructs Kinisi to initiate a parallel parking maneuver. This capability showcases Kinisi's sophisticated level of autonomous control.
