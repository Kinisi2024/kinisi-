Our autonomous vehicle incorporates a servo motor, a rotary actuator capable of precise angular movements, to enhance the steering system's 
performance. This integration seamlessly combines mechanical actuation with our vehicle's autonomous control, enabling accurate and responsive
turning maneuvers.

The servo motor, controlled by the Arduino platform, is programmed to operate within a specific range of 25° to 35°. This finely tuned range
ensures that the vehicle's steering system provides the necessary precision for navigating tight turns and executing controlled maneuvers,
critical for successful autonomous operation.
